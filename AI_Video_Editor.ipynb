        "## Clear Problem Statement\n",
        "Video content creation involves tedious post-processing. Specifically, identifying silence, removing it, and generating accurate captions manually can take hours for just a few minutes of footage. This creates a bottleneck for educators, vloggers, and content creators who need to produce accessible content quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Real-world Relevance and Motivation\n",
        "* **Accessibility:** Captions make content accessible to the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.\n",
        "* **Efficiency:** Automating the \"jump-cut\" editing style saves creators 80% of editing time.\n",
        "* **Engagement:** Short-form content (Reels/TikTok) requires fast-paced editing to retain viewer attention."
